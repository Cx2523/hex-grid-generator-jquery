# hex-grid-generator-jquery

Summary:
This repo provides the code for a jQuery function which draws a hexagon grid in any ```<div>``` that is assigned ```class="hex-grid"```. The function allows you to specify the size of the individual hexagons, the number of rows, the number of columns and the color of the hexagons. The function does not rely on any pre-existing CSS.
