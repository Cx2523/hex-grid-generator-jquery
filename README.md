# hex-grid-generator-jquery

This repo provides the code for a jQuery function which draws a hexagon grid in any ```<div>``` that is assigned the class "hex-grid". The function allows you to specify the size of the individual hexagons, the number of rows, the number of columns and the color of the hexagons.
